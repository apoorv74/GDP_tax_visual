Therefore, these countries now rely more on taxable income. Most Europeans work for service industries and would have no reason to fear a huge change in the near future.\r\n<p id=\"6499\" class=\"graf--p\">In the Middle East, these guys are the kings and they live like one,since governments usually have no need for an external income, they apply very low tax rates and most of their income is based on exporting raw materials. Most countries here have almost zero taxes.</p>\r\n<p id=\"4340\" class=\"graf--p graf--last\">It makes sense for raw resource rich countries in the Middle East to be so relaxed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf--p graf--last\">The graphic is a R product.
